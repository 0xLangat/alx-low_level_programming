# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

## 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
The output of the program should be:
The number, followed by:
	if the number is greater than 0: is positive
	if the number is 0: is zero
	if the number is less than 0: is negative
followed by a new line

## 1. The last digit
This program will assign a random number to n each time it is executed.
Print the last digit of the number stored int the variable n.
The output of the program should be:
	The string Last digit of, followed by
	n, followed by
	the string is, followed by
		-> If the last digit of n is greater than 5:the string
		   and is greater than 5
		-> If the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
		-> If the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0:the			string and is less than 6 and not 0
		-> followed by a new line

## 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
You can only use the putchar function (Only twice in your code)

## 3. alphAbet
Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line
	-> you can only use the putchar function (3 times only)

## 4. When I was having alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line
	-> print all letters except q and e
	-> you can only use putchar twice in your code

## 5. Numbers
Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

## 6. Numberz
write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
	-> you are not allowed to use any variable of type char
	-> you can only use the putchar function (twice)

## 7. Smile in the mirror
Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
	-> You can only use putchar function (twice)
## 8. Hexadecimal
Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line
	->You can only use the putchar function (3 times only)

## 9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success
Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
	-> numbers must be separated by , , followed by a space
	-> numbers should be printed in ascending order
	-> you can only use the putchar function (4 times)
	-> you are not allowed to use any variable of type char
